# reactive-native-app

## Steps to Run
1. Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.
You can run npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility
`npm install -g expo cli`

2. Add your own api key into the `env.js` file from `https://developers.zomato.com/api`. Don't worry. It is free.

3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary packages for the app to run

4. Run `npm start` to launch the Expo server. This will bring up a tab on your brower at `http://localhost:19002/` with a QR code that can be scanned from your device on the Expo iOS or Android app. There are also other options to run it through a link via email or broswer, or you can run it on an emulator.
